2.2 Network Architecture
Our network architecture implements defense-in-depth principles through carefully segmented network zones and controlled traffic flows. This sophisticated approach ensures that each component operates within its own secure environment while maintaining necessary connectivity.
The key elements of our network design include:
- Edge security layer with dedicated firewalls
- Load balancing for traffic distribution
- Docker container networks for service isolation
- Internal service networks for backend components
2.2.1 Security Layer
The security layer acts as our first line of defense against external threats while ensuring legitimate traffic reaches its intended destination. We implement:
- DDoS protection mechanisms
- SSL/TLS termination
- Request filtering and validation

- Geographic access controls - Rate limiting and throttling
2.2.2 Container Network
Our container networking strategy creates isolated environments for different service types. Within our Docker infrastructure, we maintain:
- Application network (172.16.1.x) for core services
- Service network (172.16.2.x) for supporting components
- Inter-container communication controls - Network policy enforcement
- Resource usage monitoring
3. Game Platform Core
The game platform core orchestrates all gaming operations through a carefully designed sequence of operations. Understanding this flow is crucial as it represents the primary value delivery mechanism of our platform.
Key responsibilities include:
- Game session initialization and management - Player interaction processing
- Outcome generation and validation
- Transaction coordination
- State management
- Audit logging
3.1 Game Flow Architecture
The game flow represents a sophisticated state machine that manages the lifecycle of each gaming interaction. Each step is carefully monitored and validated to ensure fair play and accurate results.
Critical flow components include:
- Player authentication and session creation - Game configuration loading
- State management and persistence
- Outcome processing
- Financial transaction handling
- Result communication
- Session cleanup

3.2 Transaction Processing
Our transaction processing system ensures the accuracy and integrity of all financial operations through a multi-step validation and execution process.
Key transaction elements include: - Balance verification
- Amount reservation
- Action execution
- Result processing
- Balance updates
- Transaction logging
- Reconciliation procedures
4. Database Architecture
Our database implementation combines traditional relational database strengths with modern caching strategies to achieve both reliability and performance.
Core database features:
- Three-node PostgreSQL cluster - Master-slave replication
- Point-in-time recovery
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Automated maintenance
- Real-time monitoring
4.1 PostgreSQL Implementation
The PostgreSQL cluster serves as our system of record, handling all critical data storage needs with enterprise-grade reliability and performance.
Implementation highlights:
- Synchronous replication between nodes - Automated failover
- Transaction consistency guarantees
- Backup automation
- Performance optimization
- Resource monitoring

4.2 Redis Cache Implementation
Our Redis caching implementation provides high-speed data access while reducing database load. This dual-node system employs caching strategies to maintain both performance and data consistency.
The Redis cluster handles several critical data types: - Session information with TTL (Time To Live)
- Game state data with real-time updates
- Temporary player data
- High-score and leaderboard information - System configuration cache
4.2.1 Cache Architecture
The cache architecture ensures data availability through replication while maintaining strict consistency rules. Our cache nodes operate in a master-replica configuration, providing both redundancy and read scalability.
Cache distribution follows these principles: - Write operations directed to master node - Read operations distributed across nodes - Automatic failover configuration
- Memory management policies - Data persistence for recovery - Real-time replication
4.2.2 Cache Strategies
We implement multiple caching strategies depending on data type and access patterns. These strategies optimize both read and write operations while maintaining data consistency.
Our primary caching patterns include:
- Write-through for critical data
- Cache-aside for infrequently accessed data - Time-based expiration for session data
- Event-based invalidation for game states
- Bulk operations for performance
- Atomic operations for consistency

5. Message Queue Architecture
Our RabbitMQ implementation provides reliable asynchronous communication between system components. This crucial infrastructure ensures message delivery while maintaining system performance under varying loads.
Message queue features:
- Guaranteed message delivery - Message persistence
- Dead letter handling
- Priority queuing
- Message routing
- Performance monitoring
5.1 Queue Implementation
The queue implementation handles different message types through specialized exchanges and queues. This design ensures appropriate message routing and processing based on message characteristics.
Implementation features:
- Direct exchanges for point-to-point delivery
- Topic exchanges for publish/subscribe patterns - Dead letter exchanges for failed messages
- Message persistence for reliability
- TTL configuration for temporary messages
- Queue mirroring for high availability
5.2 Event Processing
Event processing manages the flow of various system events through appropriate channels. This subsystem ensures proper event ordering and delivery while maintaining system responsiveness.
Event types handled include: - Game state changes
- Player actions
- System alerts
- Audit events
- Monitoring data
- Background tasks

6. Operational Architecture
Our operational architecture defines how we manage, monitor, and maintain the platform. This comprehensive framework ensures reliable operation while providing tools for problem resolution.
6.1 Monitoring and Alerting
The monitoring system provides real-time visibility into all platform components. This proactive approach allows early detection and resolution of potential issues.
Key monitoring aspects:
- Infrastructure metrics
- Application performance - Database health
- Cache statistics
- Queue depths
- Network performance
- Security events
