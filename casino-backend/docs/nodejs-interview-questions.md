# Node.js, Express, MongoDB & Security Interview Questions and Answers

---

## General Node.js & Express Questions

### 1. What is the event loop in Node.js?
**Answer:**
The event loop is the core mechanism in Node.js that handles asynchronous operations. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O by offloading operations (like file reads, network requests) and processing their callbacks when ready. The event loop cycles through phases (timers, I/O callbacks, idle, poll, check, close callbacks) and executes queued callbacks, enabling high concurrency with a single-threaded model.

---

### 2. How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations?
**Answer:**
Node.js uses callbacks, promises, and async/await to handle asynchronous operations. Internally, it uses the event loop and libuv to delegate I/O tasks to the OS, and processes their results when ready, without blocking the main thread.

---

### 3. What are streams in Node.js?
**Answer:**
Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion. Types: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform. They are used for efficient data processing (e.g., file I/O, HTTP requests).

---

### 4. How do you handle errors in Express middleware?
**Answer:**
By passing errors to the next function: `next(err)`. Express will skip to the error-handling middleware (with signature `(err, req, res, next)`).

---

### 5. What is middleware in Express? How does the middleware chain work?
**Answer:**
Middleware are functions that have access to the request, response, and next middleware. They can modify req/res, end the request, or pass control to the next middleware. The chain is executed in the order middleware are registered.

---

### 6. How do you structure a large Express application?
**Answer:**
By separating concerns: routes, controllers, services, models, middlewares, and utilities. Use folders for each, and keep files focused and modular.

---

### 7. What is the purpose of `next()` in Express middleware?
**Answer:**
`next()` passes control to the next middleware in the stack. If not called, the request will hang.

---

### 8. How do you handle file uploads in Express?
**Answer:**
Use middleware like `multer` to parse multipart/form-data and handle file uploads securely.

---

### 9. How do you implement logging in a Node.js application?
**Answer:**
Use libraries like `winston` or `morgan` for structured logging. In this repo, `winston` and `express-winston` are used for request and error logging.

---

### 10. What is the difference between `process.nextTick()`, `setImmediate()`, and `setTimeout()`?
**Answer:**
- `process.nextTick()`: Executes after the current operation, before the event loop continues.
- `setImmediate()`: Executes on the next event loop iteration.
- `setTimeout()`: Executes after a minimum delay.

---

## MongoDB & Mongoose Questions

### 1. What is Mongoose? Why use it with MongoDB?
**Answer:**
Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides schema validation, middleware, and a structured way to interact with MongoDB collections as JavaScript objects.

---

### 2. How do you define a schema and model in Mongoose?
**Answer:**
```js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, email: String });
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

---

### 3. What are Mongoose middleware (pre/post hooks)?
**Answer:**
Functions that run before or after certain operations (e.g., save, find, update). Used for validation, logging, or modifying data.

---

### 4. How do you perform transactions in MongoDB with Mongoose?
**Answer:**
Use `mongoose.startSession()` and `session.withTransaction(async () => { ... })`. Pass `{ session }` to all write operations. Ensures atomicity across multiple documents/collections.

---

### 5. What is the difference between `.save()`, `.create()`, `.updateOne()`, and `.findByIdAndUpdate()`?
**Answer:**
- `.save()`: Saves a document instance.
- `.create()`: Creates and saves a new document.
- `.updateOne()`: Updates the first matching document.
- `.findByIdAndUpdate()`: Finds a document by ID and updates it.

---

### 6. How do you handle soft deletes in MongoDB?
**Answer:**
By adding an `is_deleted` or `deletedAt` field and filtering queries to exclude soft-deleted documents. Do not physically remove the document.

---

### 7. What is MongoDB operator injection and how do you prevent it?
**Answer:**
Operator injection occurs when user input includes MongoDB operators (like `$gt`, `$ne`) that alter queries. Prevent it using `express-mongo-sanitize` middleware, which strips out keys starting with `$` or containing `.`.

---

### 8. How do you use indexes in Mongoose?
**Answer:**
Define indexes in the schema or with `.index()`. Example: `userSchema.index({ email: 1 }, { unique: true })`.

---

### 9. How do you handle relationships (references) between documents in MongoDB?
**Answer:**
Use ObjectId references in schemas and populate them with `.populate()` for joins.

---

## Authentication & Security Questions

### 1. How does Passport.js work? What are strategies?
**Answer:**
Passport.js is authentication middleware for Node.js. Strategies are plugins for different auth methods (local, JWT, OAuth, etc.). You configure strategies and use Passport to authenticate requests.

---

### 2. How do you implement JWT authentication in Node.js?
**Answer:**
Use the `jsonwebtoken` library to sign and verify tokens. On login, sign a token with user info; on protected routes, verify the token from headers.

---

### 3. What is CSRF and how do you protect against it in Express?
**Answer:**
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tricks users into submitting unwanted actions. Use the `csurf` middleware to require a valid CSRF token for state-changing requests.

---

### 4. What is XSS and how do you prevent it?
**Answer:**
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is when attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages. Prevent it by escaping output, sanitizing input (with `xss-clean`), and using CSP headers (with `helmet`).

---

### 5. What is HTTP Parameter Pollution and how do you prevent it?
**Answer:**
HPP is when attackers send duplicate parameters (e.g., `?id=1&id=2`) to bypass security. Prevent it with the `hpp` middleware.

---

### 6. How do you secure cookies and sessions in Express?
**Answer:**
Set cookies as `httpOnly`, `secure`, and `sameSite`. Use strong secrets and store sessions in a secure store (like MongoDB with `connect-mongo`).

---

### 7. What is rate limiting and why is it important?
**Answer:**
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client can make in a time window, preventing brute-force and DoS attacks. Use `express-rate-limit` or `rate-limiter-flexible`.

---

### 8. How do you sanitize user input in Node.js?
**Answer:**
Use libraries like `express-validator`, `xss-clean`, and `express-mongo-sanitize` to validate and sanitize input.

---

### 9. What is the purpose of Helmet in Express apps?
**Answer:**
Helmet sets various HTTP headers to secure your app (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).

---

### 10. How do you use environment variables securely in Node.js?
**Answer:**
Store secrets in a `.env` file and load them with `dotenv`. Never commit secrets to version control.

---

### 11. What is CORS and how do you configure it in Express?
**Answer:**
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) controls which domains can access your API. Use the `cors` middleware to configure allowed origins, methods, and headers.

---

### 12. How do you hash passwords securely in Node.js?
**Answer:**
Use `bcryptjs` or `argon2` to hash passwords before storing them. Never store plain text passwords.

---

### 13. What is the difference between bcrypt and argon2?
**Answer:**
Both are secure password hashing algorithms. Argon2 is newer and considered more secure, but bcrypt is widely used and supported.

---

### 14. How do you prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints?
**Answer:**
Use rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`), account lockouts, and strong password policies.

---

### 15. What is the purpose of `express-mongo-sanitize`?
**Answer:**
It removes keys starting with `$` or containing `.` from user input, preventing MongoDB operator injection attacks.

---

### 16. How do you use `xss-clean` and why?
**Answer:**
`xss-clean` sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks. Use it as middleware: `app.use(xss())`.

---

### 17. What is the role of `hpp` middleware?
**Answer:**
`hpp` prevents HTTP Parameter Pollution by removing duplicate query parameters.

---

### 18. How do you use `express-validator` for input validation?
**Answer:**
In your route definitions, use validation chains and check results:
```js
import { body, validationResult } from 'express-validator';
app.post('/register', [body('email').isEmail()], (req, res) => {
  const errors = validationResult(req);
  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
  }
  // ...
});
```

## React Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is the Virtual DOM and how does React use it?
**Answer:**
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the real DOM. React uses it to optimize UI updates: when state changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree, compares it to the previous one (diffing), and efficiently updates only the changed parts in the real DOM (reconciliation).

---

### 2. What are components in React?
**Answer:**
Components are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI. They can be class-based or functional. Components accept props as input and return JSX to render UI.

---

### 3. What is JSX?
**Answer:**
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It allows you to write UI code in a declarative way. JSX is transpiled to `React.createElement` calls.

---

### 4. What are props and state in React?
**Answer:**
Props are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components. State is local, mutable data managed within a component. State changes trigger re-renders.

---

### 5. What are hooks? Name a few commonly used hooks.
**Answer:**
Hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components. Common hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useRef`.

---

### 6. What is the useEffect hook? Give an example use case.
**Answer:**
`useEffect` lets you perform side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, etc.) in functional components. Example:
```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []); // Runs once on mount
```

---

### 7. How does React handle forms and input elements?
**Answer:**
React uses controlled components, where form input values are managed by state. The `onChange` handler updates state, and the input's `value` is set from state.

---

### 8. What is lifting state up in React?
**Answer:**
Lifting state up means moving shared state to the closest common ancestor of components that need to access or modify it, so they can communicate via props.

---

### 9. What is context in React and when would you use it?
**Answer:**
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without passing props manually at every level. Use it for global data like themes, authentication, or locale.

---

### 10. What is React Router and why is it used?
**Answer:**
React Router is a library for handling routing in React apps. It enables navigation between views, URL parameters, and nested routes without full page reloads.

---

### 11. How do you optimize performance in a React application?
**Answer:**
Use techniques like memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`), code splitting (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`), virtualization (e.g., `react-window`), and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

---

### 12. What is Redux and how does it work with React?
**Answer:**
Redux is a state management library. It stores app state in a single store, uses actions to describe changes, and reducers to update state. React components connect to Redux using hooks or HOCs.

---

### 13. What are controlled and uncontrolled components?
**Answer:**
Controlled components have their value managed by React state. Uncontrolled components use refs to access DOM values directly.

---

### 14. How do you handle error boundaries in React?
**Answer:**
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree and display a fallback UI. Implemented using `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError` in class components.

---

### 15. How do you test React components?
**Answer:**
Use testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library. Test rendering, user interactions, and component output. Use mocks for dependencies and simulate events.

---

### 16. What is prop drilling and how do you avoid it?
**Answer:**
Prop drilling is passing props through many layers of components. Avoid it using context, state management libraries, or custom hooks.

---

### 17. What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback?
**Answer:**
`useMemo` memoizes a computed value, while `useCallback` memoizes a function. Both help prevent unnecessary recalculations or re-renders.

---

### 18. What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React?
**Answer:**
SSR renders React components on the server and sends HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO. Frameworks like Next.js enable SSR for React apps.

---

### 19. How do you fetch data in React?
**Answer:**
Use `fetch`, `axios`, or libraries like React Query. Fetch data in `useEffect` and store it in state.

---

### 20. What is the difference between class and functional components?
**Answer:**
Class components use ES6 classes, have lifecycle methods, and manage state with `this.state`. Functional components are functions, use hooks for state and lifecycle, and are preferred in modern React.

]);
```

--- 

---

### 16. What is the difference between an embedded document and a referenced document in MongoDB?
**Answer:**
Embedded documents are stored directly inside a parent document, while referenced documents are stored in separate collections and linked via ObjectId references. Embedding is good for data that is accessed together, while referencing is better for large or shared data.

---

### 17. How do you create a unique index in MongoDB, and why would you use one?
**Answer:**
Use `db.collection.createIndex({ field: 1 }, { unique: true })`. Unique indexes prevent duplicate values in the indexed field, ensuring data integrity (e.g., unique emails).

---

### 18. What is the purpose of the `$lookup` aggregation stage?
**Answer:**
`$lookup` performs a left outer join to another collection in the same database, allowing you to combine related data from multiple collections in a single aggregation pipeline.

---

### 19. How do you update multiple documents at once in MongoDB?
**Answer:**
Use `updateMany()` to update all documents matching a filter. Example: `db.users.updateMany({ isActive: false }, { $set: { status: "inactive" } })`.

---

### 20. What is a capped collection and when would you use it?
**Answer:**
A capped collection is a fixed-size collection that automatically overwrites its oldest entries when it reaches its size limit. Useful for logs or cache data.

---

### 21. How do you perform text search in MongoDB?
**Answer:**
Create a text index on the fields you want to search: `db.collection.createIndex({ field: "text" })`. Then use the `$text` operator in queries: `db.collection.find({ $text: { $search: "keyword" } })`.

---

### 22. What is the difference between `$push` and `$addToSet` in MongoDB updates?
**Answer:**
`$push` adds a value to an array, allowing duplicates. `$addToSet` adds a value only if it does not already exist in the array, ensuring uniqueness.

---

### 23. How do you perform pagination in MongoDB?
**Answer:**
Use `.skip()` and `.limit()` methods. Example: `db.collection.find().skip(20).limit(10)` for page 3 with 10 items per page.

---

### 24. What is the Aggregation Pipeline and how is it different from simple queries?
**Answer:**
The Aggregation Pipeline processes data through multiple stages (e.g., `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`). It is more powerful than simple queries, allowing for complex data transformations and analytics.

---

### 25. How do you handle large file storage in MongoDB?
**Answer:**
Use GridFS, a specification for storing and retrieving large files (over 16MB) in MongoDB by splitting them into smaller chunks.

---

### 26. What is the purpose of the `$project` stage in an aggregation pipeline?
**Answer:**
`$project` reshapes each document in the stream, allowing you to include, exclude, or compute new fields.

---

### 27. How do you ensure high availability in MongoDB?
**Answer:**
Deploy a replica set, which consists of a primary and multiple secondary nodes. If the primary fails, a secondary is automatically promoted.

---

### 28. What is sharding in MongoDB and why is it used?

## Apache Kafka Interview Questions

---

### 1. What is Apache Kafka and what are its main use cases?
**Answer:**
Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is commonly used for log aggregation, real-time analytics, event sourcing, and as a message broker between microservices.

---

### 2. What are the main components of Kafka?
**Answer:**
Kafka consists of Producers (send data), Topics (categories for messages), Brokers (Kafka servers), Consumers (read data), Partitions (subdivisions of topics), and Zookeeper (manages cluster metadata and leader election).

---

### 3. What is a Kafka topic and how does partitioning work?
**Answer:**
A topic is a logical channel to which messages are sent. Each topic can have multiple partitions, which allow Kafka to scale horizontally and provide parallelism. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages.

---

### 4. How does Kafka ensure message durability and reliability?
**Answer:**
Kafka persists messages to disk and replicates partitions across multiple brokers. A message is considered committed when it is written to the leader and all in-sync replicas. This ensures durability even if a broker fails.

---

### 5. What is the role of Zookeeper in a Kafka cluster?
**Answer:**
Zookeeper manages metadata, configuration, and leader election for Kafka brokers and partitions. It helps coordinate distributed processes and keeps track of broker status.

---

### 6. How does a Kafka consumer keep track of which messages it has read?
**Answer:**
Kafka uses offsets to track the position of a consumer in a partition. Consumers can commit offsets manually or automatically, allowing them to resume from the last committed offset in case of failure.

---

### 7. What is the difference between at-most-once, at-least-once, and exactly-once delivery semantics in Kafka?
**Answer:**
- At-most-once: Messages may be lost but are never redelivered.
- At-least-once: Messages are never lost but may be redelivered.
- Exactly-once: Each message is delivered once and only once. Kafka supports exactly-once semantics with idempotent producers and transactional APIs.

---

### 8. How do you achieve high availability in Kafka?
**Answer:**
By replicating partitions across multiple brokers and configuring replication factors. If a broker fails, another broker with a replica can take over as the leader.

---

### 9. What is a consumer group in Kafka and why is it important?
**Answer:**
A consumer group is a set of consumers that share the work of consuming messages from a topic. Each partition is consumed by only one consumer in the group, enabling parallel processing and scalability.

---

### 10. How do you handle message ordering in Kafka?
**Answer:**
Kafka guarantees message order only within a partition. To preserve order for a key, always send messages with the same key to the same partition.

---

### 11. What are some common strategies for handling backpressure in Kafka consumers?
**Answer:**
- Adjust consumer poll intervals and batch sizes
- Use flow control mechanisms
